About Coding Grace
==================

Coding Grace are a group of developers based in Ireland who love to code and do other geeky and not necessarily crafty activities. Some of us code full-time, or just for fun (or both). We have people who are part of other technical user groups such as `Dublin ALT.NET <http://dublinalt.net/>`_, `GameCraft <http://dublingamecraft.com>`_,  `Python Ireland <http://python.ie>`_, `Ruby Ireland <www.rubyireland.com/>`_ and moreâ€¦

Who are we?
===========

.. note::

   We are a non-profit group. If you like to help and/or sponsor us, please email codinggrace@gmail.com.

Coding Grace was initially founded after a brainstorming session brought together by Andrea Magnorsky from `BatCat Games <http://batcatgames.com/blog/>`_. Those who came along were `Martha Rotter <https://twitter.com/martharotter>`_, `Julie Pichon <https://twitter.com/jpichon_net>`_, `Vicky Twomey-Lee <http://about.me/whykay>`_ and `Michael Twomey <https://twitter.com/micktwomey>`_ in July 2012.


What do we do?
==============

We provide female-friendly workshops and events in an environment for developers and aspiring developers mentored by majority female instructors.

Where many events tend to have more males than females, we aim to encourage many females to come along to our workshops and learn to code and more. We also encourage any females who want to mentor technical material to help out, it's not that scary after all. 

But why?  
========
It doesn't matter if you are learning or mentoring, gaining confidence to ask questions, helping others, which results in everyone learning from each other gives females in this field the encouragement to further their careers, attend technical conferences, or even give a technical talk at one.

We aim to provide a support network for people from all backgrounds and hope our outreach will help bring those who are interested in code development together and learn from one another.
