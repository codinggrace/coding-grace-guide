Choose what kind of workshop you want to run.
---------------------------------------------

Dublin's first workshop was introduction to Python as it was easy for me to find mentors. If you cannot find mentors, run a workshop you can instruct yourself.

Size of workshop is up to each organiser. Dublin ones are typically capped at 25 attendees, and we aim to have 1 mentor per 5 attendees.

Coding Grace workshop content (slides, exercises, source code, etc.) are shared here: `https://github.com/codinggrace <https://github.com/codinggrace>`_

Please share your workshop content here, READMEs are .md files, so please fill as much information as you can on the content as well as references and resources. If you don't know how, send me a zipped file and I will add to the repository.

Set a date
----------

Setting a date and knowing what workshop you will be running will be enough information when looking for volunteer mentors/helpers and venues.

Call for volunteer mentors
--------------------------

Here are a few suggestions to start looking for volunteer mentors:-

* Universities

* Local companies

* Local usergroups (meetup.com, mailing lists)

* Friends

Find a venue
------------
If it is possible, a city centre location. If that is not possible, try to find a venue that is easily accessible via public transport.

Venue should have at least:

* Tables and chairs (classroom setup)

* Projector (and screen)

* Decent Wi-Fi

Nice to have:

* Use of kitchenette so people can make their own tea/coffee.
